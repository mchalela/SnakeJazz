Requirements
------------

You will need to install ffmpeg for audio processing.
For example, in Ubuntu/Debian:

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install ffmpeg

You will also need a nice set of headphones to run SnakeJazz.



Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is using pip::

    $ pip install snakejazz

This will install the latest stable version on PyPI.

If you want to use the latest development version from github, unpack or clone the `repo <https://github.com/mchalela/SnakeJazz>` on your local machine,
change the directory to where setup.py is, and install using setuptools::

    $ python setup.py install

or pip::

    $ pip install -e .
